const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do I need to leave my current job to teach at Greenroots?",
    a: "Not at all. Most of our trainers teach evening or weekend batches, or record modules at their own pace, while staying in their full-time roles. The whole model is built around fitting in alongside what you already do.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much time does teaching take?",
    a: "It’s flexible. A live batch might be a few hours a week for the length of a cohort. Alternatively, you can record a set of modules once and keep earning as new students enrol — closer to passive income.",
  },
  {
    q: "How and when do I get paid?",
    a: "Depending on your engagement model — per live batch, per recorded module, or a revenue share — payouts are made on a regular cycle. The exact terms are agreed transparently during onboarding, before you ever teach.",
  },
  {
    q: "I’m a YouTuber / Instagram creator, not a corporate trainer. Is there a place for me?",
    a: "Yes — we have a dedicated track for educational and career creators. You can co-create courses, host live masterclasses, and grow your audience through our student community, turning your following into a recurring revenue stream.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I need to handle outside of teaching?",
    a: "Everything outside the teaching itself — student acquisition, batch scheduling, marketing, the learning platform, and placement support — is handled by us. You show up and teach; we run the operation around you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long until I start earning?",
    a: "Get onboarded, matched to the right course, and start earning within weeks. Our team reviews every application personally and reaches out within 48 hours if there’s a fit.",
  },
